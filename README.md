# Portfolio Mk3

![Site picture](./Assets/Images/portfolio-mk2-demo.gif)

This site was made to showcase me! At the top of the page there is a navigation bar that will display the appropriate modal if you click on "About Me" or "Contact Me", take you to the project page if you click on "Projects‚Äù or pulls up my resume if you click on resume! Please feel free to click on any of the links and contact me if I impress you! If you are on mobile and don't see it please click the hamburger menu in the top right and a dropdown menu will appear! The page is completely dynamic. This is my 3rd portfolio and I went after a simpler aesthetic compared to my second one. The page will be updated as I gain more projects under my belt.
