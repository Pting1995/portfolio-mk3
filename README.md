# Portfolio Mk3

![Site picture](./Assets/Images/portfolio-mk2-demo.gif)

This site was made to showcase me! At the top of the page there is a navigation bar that tracks if you are in the "About", "Projects", or "Contact Me" areas. If you are on mobile and don't see it please click the hamburger menu in the top right and a dropdown menu will appear! The page is completely dynamic. The page will be updated as i gain more projects under my belt.
